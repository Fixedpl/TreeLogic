Using adding with path cannot be mixed with normal adding because of id collisions. @HighPriority

Path adding doesnt work for incorrect input in string like "aaaaaa" - crash
Path adding doesnt show error if 2 same ids are passed like "0" and then "0 0" @HighPriority

After removing a node the whole tree is traversed in order to find new tree diameter. @LowPriority
This could be avoided if each node had its own subtree diameter stored. Then only logn to find new tree diameter.
